### What is Impostor Syndrome?

Impostor Syndrome is the belief that one is not good enough for a job or position, that one's achievements are lucky flukes, and an accompanying fear of being 'found out'. Impostor Syndrome seems to be particularly common among high achievers[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) who udertake publicly visible work[2](https://www.usenix.org/blog/impostor-syndrome-proof-yourself-and-your-community). Academic work is frequently undertaken alone or in small groups but the results are shared and criticised publicly. In addition, we rarely see the struggles of others, only their finished work, which can feed the belief that everyone else finds it easy. Women and minority groups, who already feel additional pressure to prove themselves in some settings, may be particularly affected. 

### Dealing with Impostor Syndrome
**For yourself**

Ask for feedback from someone you respect and trust. Ask them for their honest thoughts on your strengths and achievements. Commit to believing them.

Look for role models. Who do you know who presents as confident and capable? Think about how they conduct themselves. What lessons can you learn from them? What habits can you borrow? (Remember, they quite possibly also feel as if they are making it up as they go.)

**As a teacher** 

It can help to share stories of mistakes that you have made or things you struggled to learn. This reassures the class that it's ok to find topics hard. Being open with the group makes it easier to build trust and make students confident to ask questions. (Live coding is great for this- typos let the class see you're not super-human!).

Emphasise that you want questions: you are not succeeding as a teacher if no one can follow your class, so you're asking students for their help to help you learn and improve. It's much more important to *be* smart than to *look* smart. 

Impostor Syndrome seems to occur when individuals do not fully internalise or 'own' their achievements. There are some basic steps that can help to recalibrate expectations to be both more realistic and more positive. Identifying and addressing negative assumptions can be helpful to breaking down these negative thought 'habits' and building new patterns.

#### Exercise: Thought Record
* Remeber a time when you felt that challenging situation. Where were you? What were you doing? With whom?
* Describe the emotions that you felt (such as sad, anxious, scared)
* What thoughts were going through your mind at this time?
* What facts or evidence support these thoughts?
* What facts or evidence do not support these thoughts?
* Write an alternative thought that takes this evidence into account.
* How do you feel about this situation now?

#### Exercise: Expertise
What was the last topic someone asked your advice on? What did you do?
